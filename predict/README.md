- **Direct Normal Irradiance** (DNI) is the amount of solar radiation received per unit area by a surface that is always held perpendicular (or normal) to the rays that come in a straight line from the sun at its current position in the sky. Typically, you can maximise the amount of irradiance that a surface receives annually by keeping it normal to incoming radiation. This quantity is of particular interest to concentrating solar thermal installations and installations that track the position of the sun.

- **Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance** (DHI) is the amount of radiation received per unit area by a surface (not subject to any shade or shadow) that does not arrive on a direct path from the sun, but has been scattered by molecules and particles in the atmosphere and comes equally from all directions.

- **Global Horizontal Irradiance** (GHI) is the total amount of short-wave radiation received from above by a surface horizontal to the ground. This value is of particular interest to photovoltaic installations, and includes both DNI and DHI.
